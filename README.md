# 🚀 DevOps? More like DevOops!  

Hi, I’m Janis Adhikari – your friendly neighborhood DevOps Engineer. I make servers behave, pipelines flow, and deployments *mostly* not break at 3 a.m.

## 🛠️ What I Do  
- Speak fluent YAML (and some Bash).  
- Turn "It works on my machine" into "It works everywhere."  
- Fight bugs with Docker, Kubernetes, and caffeine.
