# 🚀 DevOps? More like DevOops (Learning Edition)!  

Hi, I’m **Janis Adhikari** – an aspiring DevOps Engineer on a mission to learn how to make servers behave, pipelines flow, and deployments 

---

## 🛠️ What I'm Learning  
- 📖 Speaking fluent **YAML** and **Bash** – or at least trying to.  
- 🛠️ Turning *"It works on my machine"* into *"It works... maybe everywhere?"*.
- 🌱 **CI/CD**: Understanding the magic of continuous integration and deployment.  
- ⚙️ **GitHub Actions**: Automating workflows one action at a time.  
- 🛠️ **Jenkins**: Trying to make pipelines that don’t crash (too much).  
- 🐳 **Docker**: Containerizing all the things (sometimes successfully).
